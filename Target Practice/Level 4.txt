This is The Hardest part. Try to understand it
To use BitBlt to draw transparent images,
you need 2 pictures.
1) The image you want to draw with BLACK it's 
   transparent color
2) The mask of that image white is the transparent color
   and Black as the solid color

Destination.cls 'Clear the destination image
Bitblt Destination.hdc, Mask.hdc, SRCAND 
'Copies the Black color only of the mask
Bitblt Destination.hdc, Sprite.hdc, SRCINVERT
'Copies the sprite
Destination.Refresh 'Refresh the destination Image
'So you may see the sprite

=>You now have a transparent sprite.

AlphaBlending with transparent sprites
You need:
1) The image you want to draw with BLACK it's 
   transparent color
2) The mask of that image white is the transparent color
   and Black as the solid color
3) The negative of that mask
4) An emtpy picturebox (buffer)

 GhostBuffer.Cls 'clear the buffer
 'Get the background image and put it to the buffer
 BitBlt GhostBuffer.hdc, 0, 0, 25, 24, Me.hdc, XX&, YY&,  SRCCOPY
'Blend the Caracter image with the background
 Alpha_Blend GhostBuffer.hdc, GhostSpr.hdc, 0, 0, 0, 0, 26, 25, 26, 25

 Now, we have:
 The buffer with a solid image of the mixture of the caracter with the  background.
 
 To make it transparant the part we want to be transparant must be black.
 So, we put the invert mask on.
 BitBlt GhostBuffer.hdc, 0, 0, 25, 24, GhostIMask.hdc, 0, 0, SRCAND
 We now have our blended ghost with black arround it
 GhostBuffer.Refresh
 'Draw the mask onto the form
 BitBlt Me.hdc, XX&, YY&, 25, 24, GhostMask.hdc, 0, 0, SRCAND
 'invert buffer to the form
 BitBlt Me.hdc, XX&, YY&, 25, 24, GhostBuffer.hdc, 0, 0, SRCINVERT

'The ghost is on the form!!!!!

Get it??

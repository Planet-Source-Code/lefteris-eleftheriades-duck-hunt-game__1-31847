Target Shooter
==============
This game is made for educational purposes
I am trying to proove that game programming
doesn't require direct X.

I am analizing all the API i know to Draw,Blend,Strech 
an image.

Objects using bitblt:
	Target, Duck, Worm

Objects using transparentblt, Bitblt and AlphaBlend
        Ghosts

Objects using strechblt
         All background images, to adjust at 800 X 600

Objects using mciplay functions
         Background Sounds, Gun sounds 

Visual Basic is also able to create 3D games without 3DSMax.
Try www.ur.co.uk for these examples
